# TCP/IP Web NET Server NVM MPFS Application

The Web Net Server MPFS configuration with QSPI peripheral demonstrates creating an HTTP web server on a Microchip evaluation board.

The Microchip Proprietary File System (MPFS) is used for reading the web pages from the internal Flash and using MPFS upload feature, the QSPI flash is updated with new MPFS file.

This demonstration uses the HTTP_NET server which supports encrypted communication through the NET_PRES layer and an external service provider for TLS support.
